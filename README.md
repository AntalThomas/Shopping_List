6. Export SQL data

## Struggles
Starting out instead of trying to just get each feature to work one by one, I tried to get it all working together at once making me waste a lot of my time trouble shooting bugs.

Deploying the website and getting Flask-session to work was a big issue for me and a few other students.

Coming up with ideas and features was probably the biggest trouble for me.

## Bugs to Fix
- If nothing is entered in the input field for adding a list or item it will still add data to the database.
- If you've crossed off an item then reload the page, the item doesn't stay crossed off.

## Future Features
- Items are automatically added into categories and displayed by their categories.
- SQL data from user can be exported to an excel spread sheet
