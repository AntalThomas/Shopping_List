# Shopping List
SEI Project 2

This shopping list app is a full-stack application developed using HTML, CSS, Python, PSQL and Flask. The app can be used to organise and check off everything you need before and after you go shopping. It will feature different categories*, quantites* and multiple list features.

## Extra Plan
1. Items can then be split up into categories
2. Different users have different lists and items

## Struggles
Starting out instead of trying to just get each feature to work one by one, I tried to get it all working together at once making me waste a lot of my time trouble shooting.

## Bugs to Fix
- If nothing is entered in the input field for adding a list or item it will still add data to the database

## Future Features
- Items are automatically added into categories and sorted
