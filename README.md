## Extra Plan
1. Items can then be split up into categories
2. Different users have different lists and items

## Struggles
Starting out instead of trying to just get each feature to work one by one, I tried to get it all working together at once making me waste a lot of my time trouble shooting.

## Bugs to Fix
- If nothing is entered in the input field for adding a list or item it will still add data to the database

## Future Features
- Items are automatically added into categories and sorted
